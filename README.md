# Paging
This program will simulate a paging algorithm using Least Recent Used and Random algorithms.This program will read the csv files that contain the paging characteristicts and will perform both algorithms, represent all the statistics for both random and LRU algorithms and will show a visual representation of the swap and physical memory after the simulation is finished.    

### What is Paging
Paging is a method of writing data to, and reading it from, secondary storage for use in primary storage, also known as main memory. Paging plays a role in memory management for a computer's OS (operating system).

In a memory management system that takes advantage of paging, the OS reads data from secondary storage in blocks called pages, all of which have identical size. The physical region of memory containing a single page is called a frame. When paging is used, a frame does not have to comprise a single physically contiguous region in secondary storage. This approach offers an advantage over earlier memory management methods, because it facilitates more efficient and faster use of storage.
